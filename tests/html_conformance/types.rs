//! Shared, dependency-free types for the AST→HTML conformance bench.
//!
//! These are the FROZEN interface between the extractor and runner/report. The
//! extractor produces [`OracleTuple`]s; the runner maps each tuple's captured
//! option tokens to parse [`markdown_syntax::SyntaxOptions`] plus public
//! [`markdown_syntax::HtmlOptions`].
//!
//! The bench renders ONE convention (GFM). The only spec-layer split that
//! survives is the suite [`Category`] (commonmark vs gfm), kept purely so a
//! handful of category-divergent oracle conventions (raw-HTML safe-mode form,
//! task-list checkbox attribute order) and the per-suite report grouping stay
//! faithful. It does NOT switch the rendering convention: math is always GFM.

/// Which suite directory a tuple came from (`suite/commonmark/` vs
/// `suite/gfm/`). A spec-layer grouping label for reporting, plus the two
/// oracle conventions whose expected HTML legitimately differs by suite layer
/// (safe-mode raw HTML, task-list checkbox attribute order).
